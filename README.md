## Setup

install [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)

It is used as a vector renderer since i couldn't find a renderer that handle 'font-variant-ligature' nor 'dominant-baseline' css rules.

install python dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
